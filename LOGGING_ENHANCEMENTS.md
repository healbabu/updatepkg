# AI Services Logging Enhancements

## Overview
Enhanced the CopilotService and SimplePackageUpgrader with comprehensive logging to provide detailed insights into AI model selection, prompt processing, and response handling.

## Enhanced Logging Features

### 1. AI Model Discovery and Selection
- **Model Availability**: Logs available Copilot models with detailed metadata
- **Model Selection**: Shows which model was selected and why
- **Model Capabilities**: Displays token limits, family, version, and features
- **Diagnostics**: Provides troubleshooting recommendations when AI is unavailable

### 2. Prompt Logging
- **Prompt Details**: Logs prompt length, line count, and context
- **Full Prompt**: Shows complete prompt for short prompts
- **Prompt Preview**: Shows first/last sections for long prompts
- **Context Labeling**: Identifies the purpose of each AI call

### 3. Response Logging
- **Response Metadata**: Logs response length, fragment count, and timing
- **Full Response**: Shows complete AI response for reasonable sizes
- **Response Preview**: Shows excerpts for long responses
- **Processing Status**: Tracks successful parsing vs. fallback usage

### 4. Performance Monitoring
- **Timing**: Measures AI call duration from start to finish
- **Fragment Tracking**: Counts response fragments received
- **Error Classification**: Categorizes failures (quota, auth, network)

### 5. Error Handling and Troubleshooting
- **Detailed Error Info**: Captures error names, messages, and stack traces
- **Failure Classification**: Identifies quota limits, authentication issues, network problems
- **Recommendations**: Provides actionable troubleshooting steps
- **Graceful Degradation**: Shows when fallback strategies are used

## Log Message Format

### Emojis for Visual Clarity
- ü§ñ AI operations
- üîç Discovery/querying
- üìã Model/data listing
- üöÄ Successful selection/execution
- üìè Capabilities/metrics
- üìù Prompt operations
- ‚è≥ Processing/waiting
- üì• Receiving responses
- ‚úÖ Success operations
- ‚ùå Failures/errors
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Warnings
- üí° Recommendations
- üîÑ Fallback operations
- üéØ Strategy generation
- üìä Analysis/statistics

### Structured Data
All log entries include structured metadata for:
- Model information (ID, vendor, family, capabilities)
- Timing data (duration, timestamps)
- Content metrics (length, line counts, fragment counts)
- Error details (names, messages, classifications)
- Context information (operation type, parameters)

## Benefits

1. **Transparency**: Complete visibility into AI operations
2. **Debugging**: Detailed error information for troubleshooting
3. **Performance**: Timing data for optimization
4. **User Guidance**: Clear recommendations for setup issues
5. **Reliability**: Fallback strategy logging for service interruptions
6. **Monitoring**: Comprehensive status tracking for AI availability

## Usage

The enhanced logging automatically activates during package upgrade operations. Users will see:
- AI capability diagnosis at startup
- Real-time AI operation status
- Detailed error analysis when issues occur
- Performance metrics in logs
- Troubleshooting guidance when needed

All detailed logging goes to the extension's log output, while user-friendly summaries appear in the progress UI.
